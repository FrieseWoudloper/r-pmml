\value{
PMML representation of the \code{ARIMA} object.
}
\description{
Generate PMML for an ARIMA object the \bold{forecast} package.
}
\details{
The model is represented in the PMML TimeSeriesModel forma.
Non-seasonal models are represented with conditional
least squares. For models with a seasonal component, the PMML can use conditional
least squares or exact least squares. Note that ARIMA models in R are
estimated using a state space formulation. When using conditional least squares with seasonal models,
forecast results between R and PMML may not match.

Transforms are currently not supported for ARIMA models.
